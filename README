README

The project is in an unknown state.
The reason is that the author doesn't know how to use GIT...


Rebuilding using 
	git
	   37  git clone https://github.com/richardghirst/PiBits.git
	   38  git clone  https://github.com/kajnorman/control-quadcopter.git


cd into control-quadcopter and
running ./controlloop -h gives :
	pi@raspberrypi ~/control-quadcopter $ sudo ./controlloop -h
	./controlloop: invalid option -- 'h'
	Usage: controlloop -v -c -s num -p Kd -d num -t num
	-v :verbose
	-c csv
	-s setpoint
	-p Proportional gain
	-d Differential gain
	-t added delay in msec
	These are the connections for the analogue to digital test:
	jumper connecting GP11 to SCLK
	jumper connecting GP10 to MOSI
	jumper connecting GP9 to MISO
	jumper connecting GP8 to CSnA
	Potentiometer connections:
	  (call 1 and 3 the ends of the resistor and 2 the wiper)
	  connect 3 to 3V3
	  connect 2 to AD1
	  connect 1 to GND
	connect GP4 to controlsignal for ESC(electronic speed control) for Brushless Motor
	pi@raspberrypi ~/control-quadcopter $



Start the servodeamon 
	pi@raspberrypi ~/PiBits/ServoBlaster/user $ sudo ./servod



Maybe the servo/servodeamon needs initialisation
pi@raspberrypi ~/control-quadcopter sudo  echo 0=50 > /dev/servoblaster
pi@raspberrypi ~/control-quadcopter $ sudo  echo 0=70 > /dev/servoblaster
pi@raspberrypi ~/control-quadcopter $ sudo  echo 0=50 > /dev/servoblaster


This will run the controllop with useable parameters
	pi@raspberrypi ~/control-quadcopter $ sudo ./controlloop  -s 600 -p 1 -d 20
