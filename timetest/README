The overall goal is to handle PD-control on a not true-time OS

To calculate the derivative of the error with a given accuracy

On a not true time OS, I cannot count on the sampling frequency being 
stable

To calculate a derivative (the slope) I need to points. (time , value)

The further these points are from each other
	The bigger value difference may be estimated
		The better accuracy of the measurement.
	The "older" is the first point.. This is like a delay


Looking at data from the actual closed loop system i can see oscillation 
with an amplitude of 40 with a frequency of 3 Hz...  This gives a 
maximal slope of 10/(1/36)  or 360[steps/sec]..  Handling frequencies of 
3 Hz I would like to have a sampling system with fs~60 Hz  Ts= 16.7 
msec.
Slope and sampling rate gives  360/60  =  6 steps @ fs=60 Hz (poor 
resolution but ok!)
